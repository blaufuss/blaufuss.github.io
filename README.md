Welcome.

I'm a research scientist at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu) in the [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.umd.edu).  

My primary research area of interest is [Particle Astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroparticle_physics). My primary focus is searches for neutrinos from astrophysical sources using the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu).
